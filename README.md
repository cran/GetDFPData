# Reading Annual Financial Reports from Bovespa's DFP, FRE and FCA systems

Package `GetDFPData` provides a R interface to all financial statements and companies information available in B3's [website](http://www.bmfbovespa.com.br/). It not only downloads the data but also organizes it in a tabular format and allows the use of inflation indexes. Users can select companies and a time period to download all available data. Several information about current companies, such as sector and available quarters are also at reach. The main purpose of the package is to make it easy to access financial statements in large scale research, facilitating the reproducibility of corporate finance studies.
